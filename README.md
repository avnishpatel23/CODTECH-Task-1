  # Task 1: TO -DO LIST WEB APPLICATION

## Overview-of-projcet

Here's an overview of a project to-do list built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:



- HTML: Provides the basic structure of the to-do list. It includes an input field to add tasks, a button to submit tasks, and a list area where tasks will be displayed.

- CSS: Styles the application to make it visually appealing. This includes the layout, fonts, colors, and the appearance of tasks (like striking through completed tasks).

- JavaScript: Handles the functionality of the to-do list. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The JavaScript code dynamically updates the list as users interact with the application.
- Key Features:
- Adding Tasks: Users can input tasks into a text field and click a button to add them to the list.
- Marking Tasks as Complete: Users can click on tasks to mark them as complete, often shown with a strikethrough.
- Deleting Tasks: Each task has a delete option to remove it from the list.
